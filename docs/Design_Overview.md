Overview
========

This game has been inspired by the [Honor Harrington series of novels by
David Weber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorverse#Setting).  The
basic idea is space fleet combat game, in 2-D, which reflects some of
the issues and challenges of moving and fighting across a solar system.

Space is big, like, really big.  Even moving around just inside a solar
system takes a long time unless you are able to accelerate at a high
level.  During a typical rocket launch using modern technology, the
payload may experience up to 5g of acceleration for a few minutes.
But this is accomplished by burning most of the vehicle's weight as
chemical propellant.

Ships in the Honorverse can sustain 500g (or more) of acceleration
using a reactionless drive system.  When moving from one location to
another inside a solar system (distances measured in light-minutes),
these ships will accelerate constantly, reach a substantial
fraction of the speed of light, and then deaccelerate constantly,
resulting in travel times measured in hours.

Momentum has consequences.  During encounters, commitment to a
particular course must be done early and with forethought.  Mistakes
can leave a fleet out of place to be effective, or fall into a trap.
